# Distributed 64-bit unique ID generator inspired by Twitter Snowflake
The IDs generated by this sequence generator are composed of -
- Epoch timestamp in milliseconds precision - 41 bits
- Node ID - 10 bits. This gives us 1024 nodes/machines
- Local counter per machine - 12 bits 
- The remaining 1-bit is the signed bit and it is always set to 0
