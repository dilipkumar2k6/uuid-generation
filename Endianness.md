# Endianness
- In computing, `endianness` refers to the order of bytes (or sometimes bits) within a binary representation of a number. 
- It can also be used more generally to refer to the internal ordering of any representation, such as the digits in a numeral system or the sections of a date.
- In its most common usage, `endianness` indicates the ordering of bytes within a multi-byte number. 
- A big-endian ordering places the most significant byte first and the least significant byte last
- A little-endian ordering does the opposite. 
- For example, consider the unsigned hexadecimal number 0x1234, which requires at least two bytes to represent. 
- In a big-endian ordering they would be 12 34, 
- In a little-endian ordering, the bytes would be arranged 34 12.
-  big-endianness is the dominant ordering in networking protocols (IP, TCP, UDP)
- little-endianness is the dominant ordering for processor architectures (x86, most ARM implementations) and their associated memory.
