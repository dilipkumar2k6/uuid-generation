# UUID
- 128 bit number
- GUID is synonym on UUID
# Format
- The 16 octets of a UUID are represented as 32 hexadecimal (base-16) digits
- Displayed in 5 groups separated by hyphens
- In the form 8-4-4-4-12 for a total of 36 characters 
- 32 alphanumeric characters and 4 hyphens
- Eg 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000
- Format xxxxxxxx-xxxx-Mxxx-Nxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
- The 4 bit M and the 1 to 3 bit N fields code the format of the UUID itself.
- The 4 bits of digit M are the UUID version
- 1 to 3 most significant bits of digit N code the UUID variant.
- N is a (10xx2), meaning that this is a version-1; that is, a time-based
- Microsoft GUIDs are sometimes represented with surrounding braces:
`{123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000}`
- RFC 4122 defines a Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace for UUIDs.
- A UUID presented as a URN appears as follows
```
urn:uuid:123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000
```
# Encoding
The binary encoding of UUIDs varies between systems. 
## Variant 1 UUID
- Variant 1 UUIDs, nowadays the most common variant, are encoded in a `big-endian` format. 
- For example, `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddeeff` is encoded as the bytes `00 11 22 33 44 55 66 77 88 99 aa bb cc dd ee ff`.
## Variant 2 UUID
- Variant 2 UUIDs, historically used in Microsoft's COM/OLE libraries, use a mixed-endian format, whereby the first three components of the UUID are little-endian, and the last two are big-endian. 
- For example, `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddeeff` is encoded as the bytes `33 22 11 00 55 44 77 66 88 99 aa bb cc dd ee ff`.
# Variants
- variant 0 (indicated by the one-bit pattern 0xxx2, N = 0..7), is for backwards compatibility with the now-obsolete Apollo Network Computing System 1.5 UUID format developed around 1988.
- Modern version-1 UUIDs
- variant-2 GUIDs
# Versions
For both variants 1 and 2, five "versions" are defined in the standards.
- Version-1 UUIDs are generated from a time and a node id (usually the MAC address)
- version-2 UUIDs are generated from an identifier (usually a group or user id), time, and a node id;
- versions 3 and 5 produce deterministic UUIDs generated by hashing a namespace identifier and name
- and version-4 UUIDs are generated using a random or pseudo-random number.
